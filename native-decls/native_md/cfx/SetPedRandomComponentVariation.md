## SET_PED_RANDOM_COMPONENT_VARIATION

```c
void SET_PED_RANDOM_COMPONENT_VARIATION(Ped ped, int p1);
```

```
p1 is always 0 in R* scripts; and a quick disassembly seems to indicate that p1 is unused.
```

**This is the server-side RPC native equivalent of the client native [SET\_PED\_RANDOM\_COMPONENT\_VARIATION](?_0xC8A9481A01E63C28).**

## Parameters
* **ped**: 
* **p1**:
